# GraphQL with Nexus

It was developed just to test Nexus lib.

I made an auto-importer for all files ending with .gql.js to make it easier to scale, because I can separate everything in components.

## Using

Just run `yarn` and then `yarn start`

## Adding components

Components should be placed inside `components` folder

## Adding schema

Just create files ending with `.gql.js`, preferably inside `components` folder and you will see it working
